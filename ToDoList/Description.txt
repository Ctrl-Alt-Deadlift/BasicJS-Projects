
To-Do List Project Description
The To-Do List project is a simple web application designed for efficient task management. Users can add new tasks by typing into an input box and pressing the "Add" button or the Enter key. The application checks for duplicate tasks and alerts the user if a task already exists. Tasks can be marked as completed by clicking on them, and each task has a delete button to remove it from the list. Event listeners handle user interactions such as adding tasks, marking tasks as completed, and deleting tasks. Local storage is used to save the tasks, ensuring the list persists even after closing and reopening the browser.
